UNESCO's 'Out of school rates' analysis project 
The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) defines Out-of-school rate as the “proportion of children and young people in the official age range for the given level of education who are not enrolled in pre-primary, primary, secondary or higher levels of education”
The dataset was retrieved from the UNESCO’s Institute of Statistics developed database for inequality in education. They made the data available to the public. The data consists of 192 countries out of school rates from the year 2000 onwards to till 2022. The data can be accessed through Visualizing Indicators of Education for the World (VIEW), a database developed by Institute of Statistics to provide estimates of two flagship Indicators: one is Out of School rate and the other is Completion rate. Our project is on Out of School rate.
Conducted multivariate analysis using Python and R. Statistical analysis include ‘t test’ to examine gender bias and ANOVA to identify significant variations in education levels.
